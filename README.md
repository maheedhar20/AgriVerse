# AgriVerse
AgriVerse is an innovative agricultural management system designed to assist farmers in Optimising Crop Yield.

It has multiple features like:
1. Crop Recommendation : Based on the Soil and Climatic conditions. Then the model predicts the best suitable crop based on the details provided

2. Yield Prediction : Based on the Crop, the Season in which farmer is cultivating it, State and District of the farmer, Area in which they are cultivating, Model predicts the Estimated Yield of the crop. Place effects the Yield because the Climatic conditions varies from place to place. As most of the Farmers can't manually enter the climatic conditions in their region, We take Place as input and retrieve Climatic conditions ourselves to make it user friendly for them.

3. Providing Information related to various Crops : It displays the Information like Optimal Temperature, Rainfall and Humidity that ensures the best yield for the crop selected by the User.

4. Improving the Models : Accurate and Verified data Collected from the Farmers can help us enhance our models.
